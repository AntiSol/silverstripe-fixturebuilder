MYSQL Fixture builder module for Silverstripe 2.4

By Dale Maggee, 2013. BSD 3-clause license.

Creates a (very basic!) YAML fixture file from your mysql database.

The idea being that you use this to dump required 'background' data from your real database for use in testing. 
In addition to the fixture generated by this, you'll also want a (manually built) fixture for your test data.

Only mysql is supported - addresses mysql directly - does not use silverstripe's DB abstraction.

There's probably project-specific code in here, may not work out of the box.

Usage:

Go to:
http://yourhost/dev/fixture-builder

Choose the tables to dump. which fields should be ignored, and whether you want to dump all records or only one.

Press 'go', wait, and save the generated file.
